readandwrite.py Description
Create a program which allows the user to
(1) Read the contents of the notebook
(2) Add notes to the file or
(3) Delete all of the notes.
If the user selects 1, the entire notebook file is printed to the screen, 
if 2 then the program prompts "Write a new note: ", and adds the written note
as the last line into the file with a trailing line break "\n". If the player
selects 3, the file is emptied and the message "Notes deleted" will be shown.
 Also add the option (4) Quit, which ends the program, printing "Notebook 
shutting down, thank you.". With other selections the program prompts
"Incorrect selection". 


NukeFootCockroach.py Description
Implement the game so that the other player is computer controlled, 
and chooses randomly either foot(number 1), cockroach(number 3) or 
nuke(number 2). Also implement a feature which keeps the score, 
calculating both rounds the player won, and ties. If the player wins, 
print "You WIN!", if they loose "You LOSE!". If the round was a tie, either 
"It is a tie!" or "Both LOSE!", depending on if the tie was caused by a nuke or not. 
If the player selects "quit", the game ends and the final score is given.
